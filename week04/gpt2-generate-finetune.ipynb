    "Other optional-but-helpful parameters for `gpt2.generate` and friends:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **`length`**: Number of tokens to generate (default 1023, the maximum)\n",
    "* **`temperature`**: The higher the temperature, the crazier the text (default 0.7, recommended to keep between 0.7 and 1.0)\n",
    "* **`top_k`**: Limits the generated guesses to the top *k* guesses (default 0 which disables the behavior; if the generated output is super crazy, you may want to set `top_k=40`)\n",
    "* **`top_p`**: Nucleus sampling: limits the generated guesses to a cumulative probability. (gets good results on a dataset with `top_p=0.9`)\n",
    "* **`truncate`**: Truncates the input text until a given sequence, excluding that sequence (e.g. if `truncate='<|endoftext|>'`, the returned text will include everything before the first `<|endoftext|>`). It may be useful to combine this with a smaller `length` if the input texts are short.\n",
