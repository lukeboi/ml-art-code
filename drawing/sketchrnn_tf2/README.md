<img style="float: right;" width="216" height="216" src="assets/rabbits_1692_144.gif"> 
This repo contains a simple implementation of the SketchRNN model with Tensorflow 2, following the best practice as much as possible.





## Setup

### Prerequisite

* pyenv
* pipenv

### Installation

After cloning the repo, run the following commands to setup

```sh
pipenv install --dev --skip-lock
pipenv shell
```

## Usage

### Training

See the [colab notebook](notebooks/train.ipynb) for an example train on the rabbit dataset.

### Results

Here are some results from a model trained on the rabbit dataset.
