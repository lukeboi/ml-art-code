For the image above, we have 9 neurons, with 32 connections (each with weight), 9 biases. This makes for 41 trainable parameters). This diagram is a fully connected network (each node connects to every node on the next layer). We call this a feed-forward network, because input data (at the left) is propogated / \"feeds forward\" from node to node in layer to layer, producing outputs (at the right).\n",
